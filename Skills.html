        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>I feel proud of my ability to communicate well. In college, group projects are common, and I often end up leading the team. Leading is not just about giving instructions; it’s about making sure everyone understands the task. I always try to listen to my teammates and consider their ideas. A good leader doesn’t just give orders—they help the team work better together. I’ve learned that patience is important because everyone has a different way of working. Some people like working alone, while others need a little guidance. I try to divide the work fairly so no one feels too pressured. I’ve also learned how to handle disagreements in a group. Sometimes, misunderstandings happen, but I believe that talking things out can solve most problems. I make sure to settle issues early before they get worse. When I present in class, I focus on speaking clearly and making eye contact. I used to be nervous, but now I actually enjoy presenting. I like explaining ideas in a way that keeps people interested. Being a leader also means taking responsibility when things don’t go as planned. If a project fails, I don’t blame others—I learn from the mistakes. I believe communication is important in both school and real life. In the future, I know these skills will help me in my career. No matter what job I have, teamwork will always be important. I also like helping classmates who struggle with confidence. Some of them are shy, so I encourage them to speak up. It feels good to see them become more confident. Leading a group is not always easy, but I enjoy it. It has helped me become more responsible and open-minded. The way I communicate now will shape how I interact with people in the future.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Watching Netflix and cooking are my hobbies to relax. After a long day of school, I love watching a good series to take my mind off things. I always say, “Just one more episode,” but I end up watching for hours. My favorite shows are thrillers because I enjoy the suspense and plot twists. I also like crime documentaries since they teach me about real-life cases. Sitcoms are great too because they make me laugh after a stressful day. Sometimes, I get too attached to characters, and it ruins my mood when something bad happens to them. Watching different series helps me understand different cultures and perspectives. I enjoy talking about my favorite shows with friends, and we always have fun debates. Even though binge-watching takes time, I try to balance it with my studies. If I have deadlines, I pause my show and finish my tasks first. As a reward, I watch a few episodes after studying. Aside from watching Netflix, I also love cooking. It started as a simple hobby, but now it’s a big part of my life. I enjoy trying different ingredients and making my own recipes. I don’t always follow instructions—I just cook based on what feels right. My favorite dishes to make are pasta and stir-fry. Cooking helps me relax because I focus only on making food. I also love sharing my meals with family and friends. It feels great when they enjoy what I cook. Cooking also helps me save money because I don’t have to buy expensive food. Even if I have limited space in my dorm, I still find ways to cook something good. No matter how busy I get, I always make time for the things I enjoy.</p>

        <h3>Interest</h3>
        <p>As an IT student who loves video games and technology in everyday life, I find it exciting how gaming and tech shape the way we live. I enjoy playing video games not just for fun but also because I’m curious about how they are made, from game engines like Unity to AI in characters. One day, I’d love to create my own game and explore storytelling, level design, and player interaction. I also follow esports because competitive gaming is growing fast, and I enjoy learning strategies from professional players. Besides gaming, I like how technology improves daily life, like smart home devices, fitness trackers, and apps that help with productivity. Streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube interest me, as they allow gamers to share their passion, and I want to understand the tech behind live streaming. Virtual and augmented reality amaze me because they create immersive experiences in both gaming and real life. Cybersecurity in gaming is also something I care about since protecting accounts and preventing cheating are important in online games. I love learning about gaming hardware, from graphics cards to custom-built PCs, because they improve performance. Mobile gaming also excites me because it makes games more accessible to everyone. I think gaming is more than just a hobby—it builds communities and friendships, which is why I love discussing game theories and in-game stories. I also like how gaming influences fashion, with brands collaborating with developers to create cool merchandise. The future of gaming, especially in AI and VR, excites me, and I hope to contribute to innovations in the industry. Balancing gaming with studies is important to me because I want to enjoy my passion while still focusing on my future. I’m also interested in how games affect the brain, improving problem-solving skills and creativity. Digital stores like Steam and the Epic Games Store are fascinating because they have changed how we buy and play games. I also admire tech reviewers and vloggers who help people make smart choices about gadgets and gaming gear. Watching gaming content online inspires me, and I hope to someday be part of the gaming industry in some way. Overall, my passion for IT, video games, and technology drives me to learn more and explore the endless possibilities in this field.</p>
